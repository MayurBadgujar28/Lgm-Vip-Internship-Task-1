          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal
          development. Educational methods include teaching, training,
          storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
          takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can
          also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
          informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on
          the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
          methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy
          initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education
          policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s
          constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976
          made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central
          and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and
          administration of education.

          Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
          prabhu.[26] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest
          recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century
          BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or
          not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had
          official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to
          have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in
          Ariano -Páli language.[27]
